## Project Description

This repository provides the necessary context to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively answer questions about the FarmSmart2 project. It contains a snapshot of the project's file structure, code snippets, and relevant metadata, allowing developers to easily integrate this information into their LLM-based applications. This helps in providing accurate and insightful responses related to the codebase and functionality of FarmSmart2.

## Key Features

*   **Codebase Snapshot:** Includes a directory listing and code excerpts for a comprehensive understanding of the project structure.
*   **LLM Optimization:** Prepares and formats the code for seamless integration with LLMs, enhancing their ability to generate relevant answers.
*   **Filter Options:** Provides tools to filter the context by file format, maximum tokens, and file extension.
*   **Location Navigation:** Allows navigation to specific locations within the repository structure.

## Installation

Since this repository provides context for LLMs, there are no specific installation steps. However, to utilize this context in your LLM application, you would typically:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mayurexh/FarmSmart2.git
    ```

2.  Adapt the provided directory structure and code snippets into a format suitable for your LLM ingestion process. This may involve converting the text to JSON, YAML, or other formats as required.

## Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (refer to the dependencies section). Then, execute the `manage.py` file using Django:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can then interact with the FarmSmart2 project through the web interface, including using the provided tools to filter and copy code snippets for use in LLM contexts.
